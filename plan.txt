Steps In Building the project:
   
   1. Data Collection From multiple Sources
      * collect the data from en.tutiempo.net
      * store The html pages in the data directory
   2. Preprocess the Data
      
      * Find the average pm value for each day the aqi csv
      * Use Beautiful soup to extract data from the Html files collected
       * create a new csv file for each year
       * Combine the csv files
   
    3. Build the Linear regression model ->Linear-regression.ipynb
        Train-score:54
        Test-score:48
       
     4. Build a Ridge and Lasso-regression model
         Train-scores:54
         Test-scores:48
         
      5.Build the Decision tree Regressor model
